<para>
This option causes a message to be issued if there is a large enough
time gap between two consecutive input records, or if the time goes 
backwards by any amount.  If the value is zero, no messages are issued.
Also, this test is only made if the input records contain times as Unix time stamps.
The value is specified as an integer in seconds.
